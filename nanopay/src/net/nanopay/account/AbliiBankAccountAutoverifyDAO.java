     * If the above mentioned checks pass, then we can set the "status" property of obj to VERIFIED
     * We do this because, we want ablii users to be able to send money to whomever they want so long
     * as they have their bank account information and email address
     * NOTE: If someone who has been added as a contact decides to create an ablii account,
     * this autoverified bank account WILL NOT CARRY OVER to their ablii account, as they will have to still set up an
     * account and verify it using the micro-deposit even if they are using the same bank information
     * Contact Bank Accounts are exlusively meant to just RECEIVE money from ablii users
     *
     * 3. FOR FLINKS BANK ACCOUNTS
     * NOTE: MIGHT WANT TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE FUTURE FOR INSTITUTIONS IDS BETWEEN 1 to 23 SINCE THESE WILL ALL REQUIRE TO LOGIN VIA THE CLIENT
     * Since flinks bank accounts are being verified by logging in from the client,
     * we can automatically verify these bank accounts when passing them through this decorator
