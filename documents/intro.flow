<h2>Getting Started Writing Documentation</h2>

NANOPAY documentation will be written in <a href="#intro-to-flow">FLOW</a>

<h4>Adding a new document</h4>

<h4>1. Add the file to NANOPAY</h4>

The first step in adding a new document is to add your file to the NANOPAY repository.  Create a file under documents/your-document.flow and put some text in there.

<h5>Filename Requirements</h5>

There are some restrictions put on the filename that your document must have.  The filename can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens and with ".flow" as a file extension.  In other words it must match the regular expression "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.flow$"


<h4>2. Add your content and iterate</h4>
After you've completed these you're ready to test and finish your document.

<ol>
<li>First launch nanos as usual use "./build.sh" in the NANOPAY respository.</li>
<li>Go to http://localhost:8080</li>
<li>Navigate your document Admin -> FLOW Documents -> "Your document name"</li>
</ol>

<p>You should see your newly written document, or an error message if the document failed to parse. To see newly edited changes you will need to rebuild.</p>

<h4>3. Committing changes</h4>

Because the document is stored as regular file in the repository, you can just add it to the git repository with "$ git add documents/your-document.flow"  Commit, push, and create a PR like you would for any other code change.

<h4>4. Dealing with parsing errors</h4>

<p>The parser does its best to report where it failed parsing and what it was expecting to encounter.  The error reporting is not perfect however, the actual error may be earlier in the document then indicated.</p>

<p>To understand the supported tags you can view the grammar used to parse the document in <a href="/foam3/src/foam/flow/Document.js">foam3/src/foam/flow/Document.js</a> line 30.</p>

<p>If you still can't determine why your document won't parse, or its missing support for your favourite HTML element, reach out to @adamvy on Slack.</p>
