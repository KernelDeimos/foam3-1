Discussion of Rails

Core each Corridor, there is one or more Rail (Transaction Service Provder), that offers FX and Payment.
For FX it sounds as though we can get by, worldwide, with Exceed.com or AscedantFX.
A few customers will manually configure a daily rate.

Require a registration or lookup of Rail by Corridor.
This can either be explicit service setup, or enabled/disabled flag in some
Rail/Corridor model.

Rails are also dependent on Amount
